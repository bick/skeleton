/*********************************************************************
This is the main SCSS file. It isn't best practice to add any
SCSS for your site here because you have the other folders and files
like breakpoints, components, partials, etc. Instead, this file
is for calling those files. If you create a new component, breakpoint,
partial, etc., make sure you add them here.

Also, don't forget to add support for SCSS on your server!
We recommend using WP-SCSS https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-scss/
