# Skeleton
Skeleton is a super lightweight development theme for WordPress.

### What is the difference between Skeleton and other starter themes?
Skeleton has almost no CSS and does not use any frameworks. In other words, Skeleton is perfect for developers who want to skip the busy work of creating the same files over and over again and just want to start making their websites. Additionally, since it's so overly simplified, it is easy to simply get going. 

### Should I fork this?
Absolutely. Please do. In fact, we strongly encourage that you make your own version of this.
